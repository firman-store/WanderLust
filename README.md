## Installation

To get started with WanderLust, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/firman-store/WanderLust.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd WanderLust
   ```

3. Install dependencies for both the client and server:

   ```bash
   npm install
   cd client
   npm install
   ```

4. Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add your environment variables. You can find a sample in `.env.example`.

5. Start the server:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

## Usage

Once the application is running, you can create an account or log in. Explore various listings, view property details, and even make bookings. As a host, you can add your own listings, manage bookings, and respond to inquiries.

## Authentication

WanderLust uses JWT for user authentication. When a user logs in, a token is generated and stored in local storage. This token is then used for subsequent requests to protected routes.

## Image Uploads

For image uploads, we use Cloudinary. Users can upload images of their properties, which are then stored securely in the cloud. This ensures fast loading times and efficient storage management.

## Map Integration

WanderLust integrates with popular map APIs to display property locations. Users can easily visualize where listings are situated, making it easier to find accommodations that fit their travel plans.

## Deployment

WanderLust is hosted on Render, allowing for live access to the application. You can view the deployed version and explore its features without setting up the project locally.
